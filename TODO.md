### First-Author Papers
Do a better job of highlighting first author papers. Your publications list you as a co-author on many high-profile papers, but your positioning in the author list isn't always prominent. Highlighting papers where you're first or corresponding author (like the AUTO-TUNE paper) would strengthen the narrative of independent scholarship.

**Ideas:**
- Add visual indicator (star or badge) for first/corresponding author papers
- Create a separate "Selected Publications" section featuring first-author work

### Research Statement / Future Research Vision
There's no articulation of your independent research program. What questions will you lead? Search committees want to see you've moved beyond supporting roles to having your own intellectual agenda.

**Ideas:**
- Add a "Research Vision" section to the bio area
- Include future research directions in the personal section
