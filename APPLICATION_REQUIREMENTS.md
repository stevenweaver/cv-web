POSITION DESCRIPTION

The School of Biological Sciences at UC San Diego has occasional openings for temporary non-tenure track lecturers (Unit 18) throughout the academic year. Courses in which lecturers are typically needed include undergraduate lower and upper division lecture courses in the areas of Physiology (BILD 2, BIPN 100 and BIPN 102), Metabolic (BIBC 102) and Structural Biochemistry (BIBC 100), Cellular and Molecular Biology (BILD 1, BIMM 100 and BICD 110), Genetics (BICD 100), Microbiology (BIMM 120), Python for biology (BILD 62), and Ecology/Evolution (BILD 3). Lab courses include Introductory Biology Lab (BILD 4), Recombinant DNA Techniques (BIMM 101), Biochemical Techniques (BIBC 103), Animal Physiology Lab (BIPN 105), Microbiology Lab (BIMM 121), Anatomy Lab (BIPN 103) and Bioinformatics Lab (BIMM 143). The full list of courses offered by the School of Biological Sciences can be found in the online course catalog.

We are especially interested in recruiting candidates committed to upholding the principles of community in higher education, and who will make a strong and meaningful contribution to the development of a campus climate that supports that commitment. Knowledge and/or demonstrated ability to address the educational and academic needs of a diverse student population, including effective teaching strategies for the advancement of students from groups who are underrepresented in higher education is an asset. Instructors for the School are encouraged to use instructional strategies tied to contemporary research on the science of teaching and learning (i.e. evidence-based teaching).

Appointees must comply with School instructions, deadlines and policies regarding course scheduling, and may need to be flexible with regards to the scheduling of their classes to accommodate the limited space availability for classrooms during standard business hours. Appointments may be full or part time, for 1, 2, or 3 quarters in duration. In the application, specify the courses or academic area(s) in which you are qualified to teach.

The School of Biological Sciences at UC San Diego is a vibrant center of scientific discovery, innovation, and collaboration. Our large research base spans many areas of biology and has one of the most celebrated graduate programs in the country. We are committed to academic excellence and diversity within faculty, staff, and student body.
