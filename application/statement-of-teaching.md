## Courses I Am Qualified and Interested to Teach

### Primary Interest: BIMM 143 - Bioinformatics Lab

I am highly qualified to teach BIMM 143 given my extensive experience developing bioinformatics software and web applications:

- **Datamonkey** (datamonkey.org): Lead developer of this web platform for molecular evolution analysis, used by thousands of researchers worldwide
- **HyPhy**: Core developer of this open-source phylogenetic analysis package
- **HIV-TRACE**: Developer of this molecular epidemiology tool, now deployed by the CDC for national HIV surveillance

My daily work involves the exact skills this course teaches: sequence analysis, phylogenetics, Python programming, and translating complex algorithms into accessible tools.

### Secondary Interest: BILD 62 - Python for Biology

My experience building production bioinformatics software in Python, combined with my work creating user-friendly interfaces for non-programmers, positions me well to teach computational thinking to biology students. I understand both the power of Python for biological data analysis and the challenges novice programmers face.

### Additional Courses

Given my background in molecular evolution and infectious disease research, I could also contribute to:
- **BIMM 120** (Microbiology) - My HIV/SARS-CoV-2 research provides current, real-world examples
- **BICD 100** (Genetics) - Computational approaches to evolutionary genetics

## Teaching Philosophy

### Core Principle: "Lower the Barrier, Raise the Ceiling"

My teaching philosophy stems from my experience developing software like Datamonkey, which makes sophisticated molecular evolution analyses accessible to researchers without programming expertise. I believe effective teaching must:

1. **Meet students where they are** - Just as good software design starts with user needs, good teaching starts with understanding student backgrounds and learning goals
2. **Provide scaffolded complexity** - Introduce concepts through hands-on experience before abstract theory
3. **Connect to real-world applications** - Students engage more deeply when they see how skills apply to current research

### Philosophy in Practice: The MEGA Workshop Example

At the 2018 MEGA Workshop (SMBE, Yokohama), I taught molecular evolutionary genetics analysis to an international group of researchers with varying computational backgrounds. My approach:

- **Started with biological questions**: "What evolutionary forces shaped this gene?" rather than "Here's how to run MEGA"
- **Live coding with mistakes**: I deliberately made (and fixed) common errors, normalizing the debugging process
- **Paired exercises**: Mixed computational novices with more experienced participants
- **Immediate application**: Participants analyzed their own datasets by day two

## Evidence-Based Teaching Practices

I am committed to using instructional strategies grounded in the science of teaching and learning:

### Active Learning

Rather than passive lectures, I structure sessions around:
- **Think-pair-share** for conceptual questions
- **Live coding** where students code along and predict outcomes
- **Peer instruction** leveraging diverse backgrounds in the classroom

### Formative Assessment

I use frequent low-stakes assessments to gauge understanding:
- Quick polling during class to identify misconceptions
- Exit tickets to guide next session's focus
- Iterative assignments that build on previous work

### Inclusive Pedagogy

- **Multiple representations**: Code, diagrams, biological narratives
- **Flexible pathways**: Core concepts required, extensions available for advanced students
- **Transparent expectations**: Clear rubrics and learning objectives

## Reflection on Teaching

### Data I Have Collected

[TODO: Add specific teaching evaluation data if available]

In my workshop instruction and guest lecturing, I have gathered feedback through:
- Post-session surveys
- Informal check-ins during hands-on exercises
- Observation of where students struggle in software interfaces (informing my software development)

### How Teaching Has Evolved

My experience developing user interfaces for bioinformatics tools has profoundly influenced my teaching. When users consistently struggle with a feature, it's a design problem, not a user problem. I apply the same principle to teaching: when students consistently struggle with a concept, I redesign my approach rather than assuming the fault lies with them.

For example:
- **Before**: Introducing phylogenetic tree building through algorithmic details
- **After**: Starting with the biological question (how are these sequences related?), using visual tree-building tools, then introducing the underlying algorithms

## Recent Teaching-Related Professional Development

### Codeathon Participation (2024-2025)

My participation in NIAID codeathons has sharpened my ability to teach computational biology:

- **NIAID "Resistance is Futile" Codeathon** (Bethesda, 2024): Collaborated with diverse teams on antimicrobial resistance bioinformatics, learning new pedagogical approaches from fellow scientists

- **NIAID BRCs AI Codeathon** (Argonne National Lab, 2025): Engaged with cutting-edge AI/ML applications in biology, directly relevant to modern bioinformatics curricula

### Impact on Practice

These experiences have reinforced my commitment to:
- **Collaborative learning**: The codeathon model—diverse teams tackling real problems—translates directly to effective classroom group work
- **Current relevance**: Staying engaged with cutting-edge research ensures my teaching reflects the actual state of the field
- **Computational reproducibility**: Modern best practices in code documentation, version control, and reproducible analysis are essential skills I emphasize

## Conclusion

My combination of software development expertise, research experience, and teaching background positions me to deliver engaging, evidence-based instruction in bioinformatics and computational biology. I am excited about the opportunity to help UCSD students develop the computational skills essential for modern biological research.
