Search Committee School of Biological Sciences UC San Diego La Jolla, CA

Dear Members of the Search Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Lecturer position in
Biological Sciences at UC San Diego (JPF04406). As a research developer
with a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Temple University and over a decade of
experience developing bioinformatics tools and educational resources, I am
particularly well-suited to teach **BIMM 143 (Bioinformatics Lab)** and **BILD
62 (Python for Biology)**.

## Connection to UCSD

I have maintained an active affiliation with UC San Diego Medical Center as a
Bioinformatics Programmer since 2011, where I continue to contribute to HIV
molecular epidemiology research through my work on the CDC's Secure HIV-TRACE
platform. This ongoing connection to UCSD's research community gives me
valuable insight into the institution's culture.

## Relevant Experience

My background uniquely positions me to deliver hands-on, research-informed
bioinformatics education:

- **15+ Years Software Engineering**: Lead developer of Datamonkey
  (datamonkey.org), a widely-used web platform for molecular evolution analysis,
  and Secure HIV-TRACE, adopted by the CDC for national HIV surveillance across
  59 U.S. jurisdictions. I have designed, built, and managed high-performance
  computing environments and led migrations from physical hardware to complex AWS
  cloud computing environments.

- **Teaching & Communication**: Guest Lecturer for "Genomics in Medicine" at
  Temple University (2019) and Instructor at the MEGA Workshop (SMBE, Yokohama,
  2018). I have a proven background working with individuals from diverse
  backgrounds and skillsets, communicating complex IT, software, and scientific
  concepts in relatable ways to ensure high engagement across disciplines and
  language barriers.

- **Research Impact**: Over 30 peer-reviewed publications with ~10,600
  citations, h-index of 23, and 5 papers in the 99th percentile of most impactful
  papers among all NIH-tracked publications. Work published in Nature, Cell, and
  Science Translational Medicine.

## Commitment to Evidence-Based Teaching

I am committed to using evidence-based teaching practices that engage diverse
learners. My experience developing user-friendly web applications for complex
bioinformatics analyses has taught me the importance of meeting learners where
they are—breaking down sophisticated concepts into accessible, hands-on
experiences while maintaining scientific rigor.

## Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

[TODO: Add specific examples of commitment to diversity in STEM education]

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the School of Biological
Sciences' teaching mission. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Steven Weaver, Ph.D. Computational Biologist & Bioinformatics Researcher
