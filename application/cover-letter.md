Dear Members of the Search Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Lecturer position in Biological Sciences at UC San Diego (JPF04406). As a computational biologist with a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Temple University and over a decade of experience developing bioinformatics tools and educational resources, I am particularly well-suited to teach **BIMM 143 (Bioinformatics Lab)** and **BILD 62 (Python for Biology)**.

## Connection to UCSD

I have maintained an active affiliation with UC San Diego Medical Center as a Bioinformatics Programmer since 2011, where I continue to contribute to HIV molecular epidemiology research through my work on the CDC's Secure HIV-TRACE platform. This ongoing connection to UCSD's research community gives me valuable insight into the institution's culture and the needs of its students.

## Relevant Experience

My background uniquely positions me to deliver hands-on, research-informed bioinformatics education:

- **Software Development**: Lead developer of Datamonkey (datamonkey.org), a widely-used web platform for molecular evolution analysis with thousands of users worldwide, and HIV-TRACE, adopted by the CDC for national HIV surveillance across 59 U.S. jurisdictions.

- **Teaching Experience**: Guest Lecturer for "Genomics in Medicine" at Temple University (2019) and Instructor at the MEGA Workshop (SMBE, Yokohama, 2018), teaching molecular evolutionary genetics analysis to international participants.

- **Research Impact**: 37 peer-reviewed publications including first-author papers on computational methods, with work published in Nature, Cell, and Science Translational Medicine.

## Commitment to Evidence-Based Teaching

I am committed to using evidence-based teaching practices that engage diverse learners. My experience developing user-friendly web applications for complex bioinformatics analyses has taught me the importance of meeting learners where they are—breaking down sophisticated concepts into accessible, hands-on experiences while maintaining scientific rigor.

## Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

[TODO: Add specific examples of commitment to diversity in STEM education]

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the School of Biological Sciences' teaching mission. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Steven Weaver, Ph.D.
Computational Biologist & Bioinformatics Researcher
