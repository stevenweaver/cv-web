## Research Overview

My research focuses on developing computational methods and software tools that accelerate bioinformatics research while having direct practical application in public health. I work at the intersection of molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and software engineering, creating accessible platforms that enable researchers worldwide to analyze genetic data.

## Current Research Programs

### 1. Molecular Epidemiology of HIV

I am the lead developer of **HIV-TRACE** (TRAnsmission Cluster Engine), a molecular epidemiology tool that has been adopted by the CDC for national HIV surveillance. The software is now deployed as **Secure HIV-TRACE** across 59 U.S. jurisdictions, directly supporting public health efforts to identify and respond to HIV transmission clusters.

**Recent contributions:**
- **AUTO-TUNE**: A method for automatically selecting optimal distance thresholds for inferring HIV transmission clusters (presented at Dynamics and Evolution 2023, CIENI HIV Meeting 2023)
- **COVFEFE**: Conditionally Orthogonal Vertices for Edge Filtering in Epidemics—improving cluster detection specificity

**Impact**: This work directly informs CDC HIV prevention strategies and has contributed to the identification of over 400 molecular clusters of rapid HIV transmission during 2016-2023.

### 2. Molecular Evolution Methods

As a core developer of **HyPhy** and lead developer of **Datamonkey**, I contribute to methods for detecting natural selection in molecular sequences:

- **Contrast-FEL**: A test for differences in selective pressures among clades
- Selection analysis methods applied to SARS-CoV-2 evolution, including identification of unusual mutational patterns in Omicron variants

**Impact**: Datamonkey serves thousands of researchers worldwide; the HyPhy paper has been cited over 1,000 times.

### 3. SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed to rapid genomic surveillance efforts:

- Selection analysis of emerging variants (Omicron BA.1, BA.4, BA.5)
- Collaborative work published in Nature, Cell, and Science Translational Medicine
- Member of global teams tracking viral evolution in real-time

## Research-Teaching Integration

My research directly informs my teaching approach:

1. **Current examples**: My active research in HIV and SARS-CoV-2 genomics provides students with timely, real-world applications of bioinformatics methods

2. **Software as pedagogy**: Tools I develop (Datamonkey, HIV-TRACE) are designed to be accessible to users without programming expertise—the same accessibility principles guide my teaching

3. **Undergraduate involvement**: The web-based nature of my software projects creates opportunities for undergraduate contributions to real research tools

## Future Directions

While this is a teaching-focused position, my ongoing research provides opportunities to:

- Involve motivated undergraduates in computational biology research
- Bring current research questions into the classroom
- Develop teaching materials grounded in active research problems

[TODO: Add specific ideas for undergraduate research involvement at UCSD if relevant]
