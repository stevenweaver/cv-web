## Research Overview

My research focuses on developing computational methods and software tools that accelerate bioinformatics research while having direct practical application in public health. With over 15 years of professional software engineering experience and over 10 years developing software in research and biomedical settings, I work at the intersection of molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and software engineering, creating accessible platforms that enable researchers worldwide to analyze genetic data.

**Scientific Productivity**: Over 30 peer-reviewed publications with ~6,700 total citations, an h-index of 22, and an iCite RCR index of ~634, including 5 papers in the 99th percentile of most impactful papers among all NIH-tracked publications.

## Current Research Programs

### 1. Molecular Epidemiology of HIV

I am the original and primary developer of **Secure HIV-TRACE**, a comprehensive platform for HIV molecular surveillance that has been in operation with negligible downtime since 2017. The system includes:

- **Front-end web application**: User interface, user/site management, security measures, administrative tools, and network storage
- **Back-end task manager**: Provisions analyses, scales for compute-heavy jobs without slowing the web application
- **HIV-TRACE pipeline**: The core analytical engine for molecular cluster detection

The platform enables public health officials to continuously perform molecular surveillance through a web application that executes the entire HIV-TRACE pipeline with few clicks. It manages inferred transmission networks over time and scales in both cloud and HPC environments. I have worked closely with security officials for over 5 years to ensure the application meets security control requirements through extensive documentation and continuous dynamic application security testing.

**Recent contributions:**
- **AUTO-TUNE**: A method for automatically selecting optimal distance thresholds for inferring HIV transmission clusters (presented at Dynamics and Evolution 2023, CIENI HIV Meeting 2023)
- **COVFEFE**: Conditionally Orthogonal Vertices for Edge Filtering in Epidemics—improving cluster detection specificity

**Impact**: Secure HIV-TRACE is deployed across 59 U.S. jurisdictions, directly supporting CDC HIV prevention strategies and contributing to the identification of over 400 molecular clusters of rapid HIV transmission during 2016-2023.

### 2. Molecular Evolution Methods

As a core developer of **HyPhy** and lead developer of **Datamonkey**, I contribute to methods for detecting natural selection in molecular sequences:

- **Contrast-FEL**: A test for differences in selective pressures among clades
- Selection analysis methods applied to SARS-CoV-2 evolution, including identification of unusual mutational patterns in Omicron variants

**Impact**: Datamonkey serves thousands of researchers worldwide; the HyPhy paper has been cited over 1,000 times.

### 3. SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed to rapid genomic surveillance efforts:

- Selection analysis of emerging variants (Omicron BA.1, BA.4, BA.5)
- Collaborative work published in Nature, Cell, and Science Translational Medicine
- Member of global teams tracking viral evolution in real-time

## Project Management and Infrastructure

Beyond software development, I have extensive experience with research infrastructure:

- **HPC Management**: Designed, built, and managed several high-performance computing environments
- **Cloud Migration**: Successfully led migration of projects from physical hardware to complex AWS cloud computing environments
- **Long-term Collaboration**: Over 10 years working with Dr. Sergei Kosakovsky Pond and Dr. Joel Wertheim, consistently providing reliable computing infrastructure, software, and maintenance

This infrastructure experience directly supports teaching computational biology—I understand the systems students will encounter in research settings.

## Research-Teaching Integration

My research directly informs my teaching approach:

1. **Current examples**: My active research in HIV and SARS-CoV-2 genomics provides students with timely, real-world applications of bioinformatics methods

2. **Software as pedagogy**: Tools I develop (Datamonkey, HIV-TRACE) are designed to be accessible to users without programming expertise—the same accessibility principles guide my teaching

3. **Undergraduate involvement**: The web-based nature of my software projects creates opportunities for undergraduate contributions to real research tools

## Future Directions

While this is a teaching-focused position, my ongoing research provides opportunities to:

- Involve motivated undergraduates in computational biology research
- Bring current research questions into the classroom
- Develop teaching materials grounded in active research problems

[TODO: Add specific ideas for undergraduate research involvement at UCSD if relevant]
